### My Portfolio

I am currently exploring TypeScript and Accessibility. This portfolio project is allowing me to do this.

The project was created with *[Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)* 
Styled with the *[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)* package
Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

This iteration may not be completed as I am looking into [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and intend on creating a project with it for a better understanding. 

Expect to see a new portfolio built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) which is a framework that will envelope the App and provide Caching, SSR, and a number of other goodies out of the box.
